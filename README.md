JHPCN-DF
========

Data compression library based on Jointed Hierarchical Precision Compression Number - Data Format

JHPCN-DF is a novel lossy compression algorithm taylored for floating point dataset. The algorithm enhances the effect of employing standard compression algorithms like deflate because this approach makes the occurence rate of the same byte pattern in data stream higher owing to truncating some lower bits of significand.
