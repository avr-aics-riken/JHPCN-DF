The algorithm enhances the effect of employing standard compression algorithms like defrate because this approach makes the occurence rate of the same byte pattern in data stream higher owing to truncating some lower bits of significand. \r\n\r\n### License\r\n* BSD (2-clause) license\r\n\r\n### Software Requirement\r\n* Zlib\r\n\r\n### Contributors and Contact\r\n* Katsumi   Hagita     hagitakatsumi@gmail.com\r\n* Masao     Ogino      masao.ogino@cc.nagoya-u.ac.jp\r\n* Takahiro  Inoue\r\n* Aya       Marumo\r\n* Yasuhiro  Fujihara\r\n* Kenji     Ono        keno@riken.jp\r\n* Naoyuki   Sogo","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
